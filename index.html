    <h1>Kuala Heaven</h1>
    <img src="images/restaurant-bar-coffee-shop-royalty-free-thumbnail.jpg" alt="My test image">
    <p>Kuala Lumpor is the capital of Malysia. If I say a piece of heaven has fallen down in that piece of land, you might say I'm exaggerating!</p>
    <p>In my first visit to Kuala, I was on my honeymoon, when we reached the hotel, unpacked some of our luggage, I told her to go take a quick walk to see where we are!</p>
    <p>I literally couldn't believe my eyes! Is that really true?! Those people are friendly that I think they are angels!, Those little green grass spots at each tile joint!, and those clean streets!</p>
    <p>We ended up touring all around the neighbourhoods around ours and we also visited many places on that very first day</p>
    <ul>
      <li> The Muzium Telekom, which is the communications museum.</li>
      <li> The twin towers or Petronas towers.</li>
      <li> Cathedral of St. John the Evangelist</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You can check Kuala's history from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuala_Lumpur">here</a>
